# ROCK SCISSORS PAPER LIZARD SPOCK GAME
## Purpose
The basic rock, scissors, paper game  can be  traced back to the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) It has been used in court cases to resolve disputes (USA 2006 - Avista Management v. Wausau), in sports matches (UK Womens Super League where there was no coin it was used to decide who would kick off).
There are also the World Societies and Associations and numerous global  championships. 

The live website can be found [here](https://andyk8872.github.io/project-2/).
